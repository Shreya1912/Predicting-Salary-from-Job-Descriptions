# Predicting-Salary-from-Job-Descriptions

The main objective of this project is to use the data we web scrapped using BeautifulSoup from Indeed’s website. We mainly focused on jobs including data scientist, data analyst, and business analyst that’s been posted across the United States. The goal is to make predictions on data-related jobs and see whether the estimated salary will be higher or lower than the median salary that we calculated from our training set. 

Firstly, we conducted background research on how indeed works in the industry, what are the competitive advantages that makes Indeed a trending website for employers and job seekers. 

We also did research on why our analysis will make a positive impact on the job search market, which is to help people make estimations on expected salary for data-related jobs when it's unavailable on Indeed. 

By building machine learning models and identifying feature importance, we are able to utilize keywords in job titles, job synopsis, company ratings, and more available information to make predictions. 

Three major machine learning models were studied in this project, which are Random Forest, Logistic Regression, and the Gradient Boost model. In all, the three models performed with a relatively similar cross-validation average accuracy score between 55% to 60%. The Random
Forest model performs the best among those three with accuracy of 61.9%. 

Based on our analysis, we also provided keywords recommendations for job seekers to watch out when they are applying to data-related jobs. In the end, we summarized our analysis and found the potential improvement of model performance which is to increase the size of the training set as well as to keep tuning parameters which may further improve our prediction.
